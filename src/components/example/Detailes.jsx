        What Is A Catalog?
        </div>
        <div className='text-area'>
        A catalog is basically the list of products that you want to sell. You can upload a single catalog or you can upload catalogs in bulk using a csv (excel) file. Within each catalog, you can have a minimum of 1 product and a maximum of 9 products of the same category that you want to sell.
        For example, you want to sell 6 sarees, then within the same catalog, you can upload all the 6 products together. But if you want to sell 1 saree and 1 kurta, you will have to upload a different catalog for each category.

        How To Upload A Catalog?
        </div>
        <div className='text-area'>
        It is now very easy to upload single catalogs or bulk catalogs on Meesho! The product catalog gets live post 72 hours from the time of upload.
        While uploading a catalog, you will have to select a category first and then upload the product images. Uploading more than one image for your product is recommended to give the customers a better view of your product. The detailed image guidelines will be provided in the Meesho Supplier panel. For each product, you will have to then fill in details like the Price, GST, etc.
        It is recommended that you create a catalog with at least 3-4 products to increase the chances of getting an order. We also recommend uploading at least 5-7 catalogs in the first few days to get better visibility.
        We recommend you review the legal and policies section in the Supplier Panel to ensure your uploaded catalogues are in compliance with the policies of ZordShop.
